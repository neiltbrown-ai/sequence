# Sequence — Case Study Taxonomy

Canonical list of industries and disciplines for tagging case studies. Read before authoring any new case study, or when retagging an existing one. The vocabularies below are also the canonical source for the assessment's Q1 industry options (`src/lib/assessment/questions.ts`) — keep these in sync.

---

## Why two axes?

- **Industries** describe the *sector* the case study lives in — where the work serves, what economic ecosystem it operates in.
- **Disciplines** describe what the practitioner *does* — their craft, their professional identity.

A music producer working on film scores → `industries: ["music", "film_tv"]`, `disciplines: ["production"]`
A graphic designer running a brand studio → `industries: ["design"]`, `disciplines: ["design", "leadership"]`

Two axes enables filtering like:
- "All Music industry cases" → Rubin, Eno, FKA Twigs, Beats by Dre
- "All Direction discipline cases across any industry" → film directors + creative directors + theater directors
- "Music + Production" → producers specifically

## Frontmatter pattern

```yaml
industries: ["music"]                                      # 1-2 typically, max 3
disciplines: ["production", "direction"]                    # 1-3 typically, max 4
discipline: "Music Production / Strategic Direction"        # human-readable display string
```

- **`industries: string[]`** — for filtering, recommendation rollup, analytics. Slugs from the canonical list below.
- **`disciplines: string[]`** — for filtering across the second axis. Slugs from the canonical list below.
- **`discipline: string`** — the prose header rendered on the case study detail page. Freeform; describes the practitioner's specific configuration.

The legacy `industry: string` field (singular) is **deprecated** as of May 2026 — kept temporarily for backward-compat during migration, then removed.

## Tagging rules

1. **Industries**: 1–2 typically. Max 3 only if the case is genuinely cross-industry (e.g., a fashion designer who has also built a hospitality brand). One-off project crossovers don't count.
2. **Disciplines**: 1–3 typically. Max 4. Be honest about what they actually *do* day-to-day.
3. **Order matters**: most-prominent first. The first industry is the "primary" — used for default sorting and rollup.
4. **Be conservative.** Don't over-tag. A case primarily about music production with a tangential film-score project is `industries: ["music"]`, not `["music", "film_tv"]`.

## Edge cases / common pitfalls

1. **Multi-hyphenate cases** (designer-author, producer-director) — list ALL the disciplines; pick the PRIMARY industry. A graphic designer who also writes books is `industries: ["design"]`, `disciplines: ["design", "writing"]`. Industry is about reputation/scene; discipline is about craft.

2. **Crossover cases** (designer working in film) — both industries OK only if the secondary work is substantial and ongoing. Resist if the secondary is just one project. When in doubt, primary industry only.

3. **Founder + craft cases** — almost always tag both `leadership` and the primary craft discipline. A founder of a brand studio who still designs hands-on is `disciplines: ["design", "leadership"]`. A founder who has stepped fully into operations is just `["leadership"]` (rare for the cases Sequence covers).

4. **Performer-creator cases** (musicians who write and perform their own work) — usually `["performance", "writing"]` if songwriting is central; `["performance"]` alone if interpretive. `["production"]` adds only if they self-produce.

5. **Studio-as-brand cases** (MSCHF, Pentagram) — primary industry of the work, plus `disciplines: ["leadership"]` and the practice discipline. `industries: ["design"]` if visual; `industries: ["design", "advertising"]` if campaign-led.

6. **Case studies that span eras** (someone whose career changed industries) — tag the industries the case study materially covers. If the case is about their pivot, both industries belong.

7. **"Other" doesn't exist.** If a case genuinely doesn't fit any of the 16 industries, that's a signal we should add an industry — not that we should bucket it loosely. Surface it with the librarian for taxonomy review rather than picking the closest-fit.

## Provenance

Defined: 2026-05-06 (during the portal refinements + vocab cleanup session).
Backfilled into the corpus: 2026-05-07 (Phase 1 of the rollout — 104 cases tagged via Claude API, with human review of calibration + final proposals).
Replaces: ad-hoc freeform `discipline: string` (~104 unique values across 104 cases) and a 9-value `industry: string` enum that had collapsing categories like Writing / Media / Publishing / Audio.
Aligned with assessment Q1 industry vocabulary: Phase 3 (2026-05-07) — `src/lib/assessment/questions.ts` now imports `INDUSTRIES` from `src/lib/case-studies/taxonomy.ts`, and `assessments.discipline` stores `IndustrySlug` values. 8 legacy assessment slugs renamed (`visual_arts` → `visual_art`, etc.) and 6 new industries added (`photography`, `comics`, `comedy`, `media`, `hospitality`, `gaming`) — each with its own Section 4B question pool. Migration `00018_normalize_assessment_industry.sql`. See `seq-assessment-build-spec-v3.md` for the question pools.
Companion docs:
- `case-study-components.md` — MDX component toolkit
- `case-study-editorial-conventions.md` — voice register, evidence rules, structure conventions
- `library-expansion-candidates.md` — patterns surfaced by the audit that don't yet have a structure
